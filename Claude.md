ROLE
You are the PLANNING AGENT for a large-scale medical imaging project. Your output is an explicit, end-to-end technical plan (not code) that another agent will implement. Be concrete, comprehensive, and unambiguous.

PROJECT GOAL
Adapt the Keras 3D CT example for pneumonia to intracranial aneurysm detection in brain imaging, with MULTIMODAL inputs and MULTI-LABEL, MULTI-CLASS outputs:
• Modalities: 
  – NIfTI volumes (*.nii / *.nii.gz) grouped by SeriesInstanceUID
  – DICOM slices (*.dcm) grouped by SeriesInstanceUID or matched by SOPInstanceUID
• Task: detect presence of aneurysm(s) and classify location(s) across anatomically defined classes (multi-label). Also emit an aggregate “any-aneurysm” score.

INPUT ARTIFACTS & DATA LOCATION
• Example to adapt: a local file named `3D_image_classification.py` or a notebook with equivalent contents (Keras’s 3D CT classification example).
• Metadata CSV: `/mnt/data/merged_medical_data_train.csv`
  – Must include at least SeriesInstanceUID and (when available) SOPInstanceUID, labels, study- or series-level identifiers, and any useful metadata (age/sex/scanner/etc.).
• Dataset ZIP (2.0 GB): `/lustre/work/sweeden/rsna-intracranial-aneurysm-detection.zip`
  – Contains NIfTI and DICOM files. 
  – NIfTI association rule: filename contains the SeriesInstanceUID.
  – DICOM association rule: match SOPInstanceUIDs for target instances or collect all slices that share the SeriesInstanceUID when SOPInstanceUID is not exhaustive.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES (PLANNING ONLY)
Produce a single planning document with sections A–K:
A) Problem reformulation
   • Define outputs: a vector of K location classes (multi-label, sigmoid) + a separate “any-aneurysm” probability. Clarify K and how to derive labels from the CSV.
   • Define unit-of-analysis (study- or series-level) and how to aggregate per-slice to per-series when using DICOM.
B) Data inventory & manifest schema
   • Specify a build step that scans the ZIP, constructs a manifest (Parquet/CSV) mapping each sample-id to:
     – paths or zip members for NIfTI volume(s)
     – ordered list of DICOM slices for that series (sorted by InstanceNumber), with (slope, intercept) for HU conversion
     – labels (multi-label vector), patient/study/series IDs
     – optional tabular covariates (age, sex, scanner, etc.)
   • Define deterministic sharding for K-fold CV with patient-level grouping (no leakage).
C) Preprocessing (per modality)
   • NIfTI: nibabel load → HU clamping → windowing strategy for brain → intensity normalization → isotropic resampling → depth/height/width target (e.g., 128×128×64) with rationale.
   • DICOM: assemble 3D volume from slices; convert to HU via rescale slope/intercept; apply brain-appropriate window(s); normalize; resample; pad/crop to same target shape.
   • Windowing sets for brain (brain / subdural / stroke) and which to use; include multi-window channels vs. single-window baseline.
D) Multimodal fusion strategy
   • Branch A: 3D CNN for NIfTI volume.
   • Branch B: 3D CNN for reconstructed DICOM volume (or learned window-stacked channels).
   • Optional Branch C: small MLP for tabular covariates (from the CSV), if present.
   • Late fusion via concatenation → dense layers → K sigmoid outputs (+ “any-aneurysm”).
   • State the exact input shapes and dtype.
E) Model family & baseline
   • Start with a compact 3D CNN baseline similar to the Keras example; specify blocks, filters, kernel sizes, normalization, dropout, and activation.
   • Provide an extended variant (residual 3D blocks) for scaling.
F) Losses, metrics, class imbalance
   • Multi-label focal loss or weighted BCE with class weights derived from prevalence.
   • Metrics: per-class AUROC/AP, macro/micro AUROC, macro-F1, calibration (ECE), and overall “any-aneurysm” AUROC.
G) Data pipeline & performance
   • tf.data pipeline with streaming from ZIP (python `zipfile` + generators) OR staged extraction to a local scratch; cache as TFRecords for repeated epochs.
   • Mixed precision; gradient accumulation option; prefetch/autotune; deterministic seeds.
H) Training protocol
   • K-fold CV with patient grouping; early stopping on macro-AUROC; LR schedule; epochs, batch size; mixed precision guidelines; checkpointing.
   • Clear experiment bookkeeping (TensorBoard logs dir schema).
I) Validation & testing
   • Fold-averaged performance with confidence intervals (bootstrap).
   • Held-out test split rules; leakage checks; sanity checks (random label and slice shuffling baselines).
J) Explainability & diagnostics
   • 3D Grad-CAM/Integrated Gradients for positive predictions; per-class confusion, PR curves; error analysis by scanner/site if available.
K) Risks & mitigations
   • Missing modalities (only NIfTI or only DICOM) → graceful fallback.
   • Memory pressure from large volumes → patch-based fallback or stronger downsampling.
   • Severe imbalance → focal loss, class weights, oversampling.
   • Reproducibility: fixed seeds, deterministic ops where feasible.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
• Respect the association rules from the user: NIfTI by SeriesInstanceUID in filename; DICOM by SOPInstanceUID search, else by SeriesInstanceUID.
• Convert DICOM pixels to HU using RescaleSlope/RescaleIntercept; then apply brain-appropriate windowing before normalization.
• Use Keras 3 / tf.keras. No external heavy frameworks. Use `nibabel` and either `pydicom` or `tensorflow-io` for DICOM.
• Ensure every step is automatable from CLI, headless-friendly on Linux/HPC.
• No PHI exposure. Keep outputs de-identified. Include a “Not for clinical use” disclaimer in README.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return only one artifact: a numbered plan with sections A–K as above. Each bullet must be specific enough that an implementer can code directly from it without guessing. Use precise shapes, datatypes, names of files to be created, and exact metric definitions. Do not write any code.
